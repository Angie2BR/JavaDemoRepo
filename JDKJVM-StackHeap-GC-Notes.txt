--Anatomy of JDK:
--Java Development Kit
    --consists of all the tools necessary to write, run, and debug Java

    --Development tools: used to compile java code
    --JRE
        --Java Runtime environment
        --all that's necessary to RUN a java program
        --Contains the JVM and standard library
        --JVM
            --Java Virtual Machine
            --JIT compiler
                --'Just in Time'
                --Feeds instructions to the machine

--Stack vs Heap
    --Stack(call stack specifically)
        --first in, last out
        --constists of 'stack frames' 
            --where we are in a program(what function/method)
            --what local variables exist here
    --Heap
        --large less structured set of continuous memory
        --Stores Objects themselves

--Garbage collection/Memory management
    --Runs periodically
    --checks the heap for objects that have no references and deletes them
    --if we have no reference for an object, there is no way for us to use it 
    --As developers, We have NO WAY to control the GC
        --we can request the GC to run
        --we can define methods to run when objects are collected***
